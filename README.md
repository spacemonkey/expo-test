This is a simple test app using expo to demonstrate a local notification. The app should do the following:

1. Load
2. Set a notification for ten seconds in the future

Once you see the text rendered on your screen, kill the app (long swipe on iPhone X, for example). The app *has to be in the background for the notification to actually work.*

Once you see everything is working fine, go ahead and generate an ios standalone build and submit to TestFlight. Even with a fully configured app and associated developer app account with certificates setup, the local notifications simply do not fire.

Why?
